Microverse JS Project #2 -> JS Restaurant Page

# JS - Restaurant Page

![screenshot](./docs/images/screenshot_of_3_pages.png)


In the project I created a simple restaurant website using JS6 and finished the following milestones:

- [x] Miltestone 1 - Set up an HTML skeleton inside of dist/index.html with single `<div id="content">` element.
- [x] Miltestone 2 - Set the style, image file loaders with Webpack.
- [x] Miltestone 3 - Create a bare-bones homepage for a restaurant with homepage, menu page and contact page.
- [x] Miltestone 4 - Each module exports a function that creates element, adds the appropriate content and styles to that element and then appends it to the DOM.
- [x] Miltestone 5 - Navbar is created and 
- [x] Miltestone 6 - Tab-switching logic for navbar with listener is created.
- [x] Miltestone 7 - Implement PubSup pattern to populate specific pages on specific time.
